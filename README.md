# vite-solid-surrealdb

# Status
- prototype /unstable
- testing / learning ...

# Programs:
- Nodejs 16.17.0
- SurrealDB 1.0.0 beta 7


# Information:

 Using the vite and solid js package with nodejs to run http server web.

 The SurrealDB is currently in beta build. The api may change depend users working on the stable.

 To develop and test how chat message work with permission as well develop simple game. One reason is reduce call from the server web http and go to directly to Surreal database with permission and authority logic.


# Database:

	SurrealDB build on rust language. There is no UI that not yet release. Since SurrealDB run by command line to start server. It can used http Rest API query, SQL script, websocket and command line.

 SurrealDB has couple of way of handle database for json, doc, strict schemafull and schemaless table. 
 
 There is permissions for authority users for access tables. By default the config is empty in the database. As code developer can set up and custom way to setup scope access and define them. Note exposing the public required strict schema set up and permissions.

```sql
DEFINE TABLE user SCHEMALESS
  PERMISSIONS
    FOR select, update WHERE id = $auth.id, 
    FOR create, delete NONE;
DEFINE INDEX idx_email ON user COLUMNS email UNIQUE;
```
	This deal with duplicate email that it must be UNIQUE. As well set up user account.

```sql
DEFINE SCOPE allusers
SESSION 14d
SIGNUP ( CREATE user SET settings.marketing = $marketing, email = $email, pass = crypto::argon2::generate($pass), tags = $tags )
SIGNIN ( SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = $email AND crypto::argon2::compare(pass, $pass) )
```


 There are two or more ways of doing things to connect to the Surreal database. One is server, client, command line, http rest api call and websocket. The fetch post work for javascript client for REST API for SurrealQL.

```command line
DATA="INFO FOR DB;"
curl --request POST \
	--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
	--user "root:root" \
	--data "${DATA}" \
	http://localhost:8000/sql
```

 - https://surrealdb.com/docs/cli/sql
```command line
surreal sql --conn http://localhost:8000 --user root --pass root --ns test --db test --pretty
```
	You can query. It found in docs.
```
--pretty //for easy read string output.
surreal //note depend terminal effect error
./surreal //note depend terminal effect error 
```

```command line
npm install surrealdb.js //server
```
```js
import SurrealDB from 'surrealdb.js'

const db = new SurrealDB('http://127.0.0.1:8000/rpc');

async function main() {
	// Signin as a namespace, database, or root user
	await db.signin({
		user: 'root',
		pass: 'root',
	});

	// Select a specific namespace / database
	await db.use('test', 'test');
}
main();
```

```
npm install surrealdb //client
```
```js
import SurrealDB from 'surrealdb'
const db = new SurrealDB('http://127.0.0.1:8000', {
	database: 'test',
	namespace: 'test',
	//user: alias(),
	user: email(),
	pass: passphrase()
});
console.log(db)
async function main() {
	let result = await db.Query('SELECT * FROM user;')
	console.log(result)
}
main();

```

 Note there websocket but there no docs added to learn it.

 Added simple script from searching community posts.

 You can read more on the docs on their site.

 Work in progress.

# Docs:
 - https://surrealdb.com/docs/start
 - https://surrealdb.com/docs/integration/libraries/nodejs
 - https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/statements/define
 - https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealql/functions


# Set Up:

- Install Nodejs
- Install SurrealDB https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb

```
npm install nodemon
```
	This for http request server api files auto restart in server side script.

## windows:
	Need to use command line since stand alone execute program for database.

run.bat
```
surreal start --log debug --user root --pass root memory
```

```
./surreal start --log debug --user root --pass root memory
```
memory = does not store just tmp ram store
